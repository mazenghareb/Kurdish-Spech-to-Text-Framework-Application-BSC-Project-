A speech-to-text (STT) framework is as its name suggests; A method for changing the expressed words by means of sound into literary documents that can be utilized later for any reason.   Speech-to-text Technology is very helpful. It very well may be utilized for a great deal of uses, for example, a computerization of translation, composing books/writings utilizing your very own sound just, empowering entangled investigations on data utilizing the created literary records and a ton of different things.   Previously, the discourse to-content innovation was ruled by restrictive programming and libraries; Open source choices didn't exist or existed with extraordinary constraints and no network around. This is changing, today there are a ton of open source discourse to-content instruments and libraries that you can utilize at the present time.Kurdish language had not utilized before in these area or there is not many studies in this field, therefor , our point is to training  models to improve the speech-to-text technology and show signs of improvement results for recognizing Kurdish speech. The speech recognition category is still primarily commanded by restrictive programming monsters like Google and IBM (which do give their very own shut source business administrations for this), yet the open source options are promising. There is several open source project : 1-Project DeepSpeech 2-Julius 3-Wav2Letter++ 4-DeepSpeech2
